# Workday Scheduler

## Description

Simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day. This app will run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS with jQuery.

## Usage

The current day and date is displayed at the top of the calendar.

As the day progresses, the time blocks will change from green (future hours), to red (current hour), and then grey (past hours).

Click into a time block to enter an event or task, then click the save icon to store that data into localstorage so that it is available on page reload.
